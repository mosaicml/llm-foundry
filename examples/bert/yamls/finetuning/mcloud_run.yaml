# This YAML is built to work with the `sequence_classification.py` starter script!
#
#   Follow the instructions in that script to modify the `build_my_dataloader` function
#   and fine-tune a BERT model on your own dataset!
#
#
#   Note that some of the fields in this template haven't been filled in yet.
#   Please resolve any empty fields before launching!
#   When ready, use `mcli run -f yamls/finetuning/mcloud_run.yaml` to launch
