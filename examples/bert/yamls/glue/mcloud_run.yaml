# This YAML is intended to serve as a reference for running on the Mosaic Cloud
# The config from `yamls/glue/mosaic-bert-base-uncased.yaml` is copied into the `parameters` field below.
# You can copy/modify the contents of this file to run different workloads, following the other
# examples in this directory.
#
# Note that some of the fields in this template haven't been filled in yet.
# Please resolve any `null` fields before launching!
#
# When ready, use `mcli run -f yamls/glue/mcloud_run.yaml` to launch
