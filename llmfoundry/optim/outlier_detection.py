class OutlierDetector:
    """OutlierDetector.

    This class implements an algorithm to detect outliers in sequential
    numeric data (e.g. for gradient/moment norms in optimizers). It relies on a
    delayed moving average which is the moving average of observations from time
    step T-2*`delay_interval` to T-`delay_interval`. The motivation is that
    outliers typically occur in clusters that can potentially stretch for many
    observations, hence it's best to use a delayed moving average to detect
    outliers.

    It defines an outlier as any data point that is `threshold` times larger than the delayed moving average.

    The class assumes data is inserted sequentially at evenly spaced intervals of unit length 1.

        the windowed moving average from [T-2*`delay_interval` : T-`delay_interval`].

        This algorithm first moves recent data into an intermediate circular buffer, and then moves data in to the delayed moving average buffer
        once it is old enough to be evicted from the intermediate data. This is to ensure that we take a delayed moving average that doesn't include recent data.
