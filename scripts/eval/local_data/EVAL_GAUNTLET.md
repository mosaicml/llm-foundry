    MPT-7B vs MPT-30B compared on the 6 categories of Eval Gauntlet v0.
</p>
The Mosaic Eval Gauntlet is MosaicML’s new technique for evaluating the quality of pretrained foundation models. The Eval Gauntlet encompasses 35 different benchmarks collected from a variety of sources, and organized into 6 broad categories of competency that we expect good foundation models to have. We compiled the categories after an extensive review of existing LLM publications, and open source evaluation harnesses such as EleutherAI Eval Harness and Stanford CRFM’s HELM.

<br>
While deciding which benchmarks to include, we had a few criteria in mind. We wanted benchmarks to require a broad range of skills that were useful for practical applications, we wanted them to come from a diverse range of sources, we wanted them to capture skills that have been traditionally emphasized by the research community as well as those that have been underexplored, and we wanted them to be evaluated via simple, unambiguous metrics such as exact match and multiple choice accuracy. The philosophy behind compiling aggregate scores as opposed to the more common approach of reporting individual metrics, is two-fold.

1. LLMs are the first generation of true generalist models. They are sought after because they can do tens of thousands of different tasks well with only a little bit of prompting. This capacity cannot be adequately captured with only 10 different academic benchmarks. It wouldn't be possible to define and evaluate every conceivable task an LLM could be used for, but with Composer's blazing fast ICL evaluation, it is certainly worth a shot!

2. Using a small set of metrics can be produce misleadingly high variance. This can lead us into thinking models' abilities are starkly different, even when a few minutes of interacting with the models will reveal that they feel pretty similar. By aggregating scores across dozens of benchmarks, we can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and get more robust estimates of models' relative performance.

Furthermore, we made the unique design decision to report multiple separate aggregate scores organized by category, rather than a single monolithic metric. This is because end users frequently want to deploy models for specific use-cases. There are many design decisions that go into training a model for a specific vertical, including dataset mixture. By decomposing model performance into a manageable set of core competencies, we can make more intelligent design decisions during the model training process.

At evaluation time, we run all the benchmarks, average the subscores within each category, and report the composite score for each category as well as the average of the composite scores. Some benchmarks are multiple choice examinations, for which it is possible to get above 0% accuracy with just random guessing. In order to ensure that all our composite scores are less than or equal to 1, we subtract the random baseline accuracy and rescale the remainder by 1 minus the baseline accuracy.

For example, if benchmark A has a random baseline accuracy of 25%, and the model achieved 30%, we would report this as (0.3 - 0.25)/(1-0.25) = 0.0667. This can be thought of as the accuracy above chance rescaled so the max is 1. For benchmarks in which the random guessing baseline accuracy is ~0 we report the accuracy as is. Note that with this rescaling, a model could technically score below 0 on a category as a whole, but we haven’t found this to occur with any of the models we’ve tested.

This is version v0.1.0 of the Eval Gauntlet.
