{"context": "Passage: Editorial: The structure of the present school calendar was established to satisfy the requirements of early-twentieth-century agricultural life. In those days, farmers needed their children to have long breaks during which they could remain at home and help with the harvest. The contemporary school year is thus made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. But agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens, so we can now make changes that serve the interests of children. Therefore, long breaks should be removed from the school calendar.\nQ: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends?\nChoices:\nA.) Children of farmers need to continue observing a school calendar made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks.\nB.) A change in the present school calendar that shortened breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life.\nC.) During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned.\nD.) A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks.\nAnswer:\nChoices:\nA. A\nB. B\nC. C\nD.

Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.\nB.) The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.\nC.) Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.\nD.)

To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.\nQ: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?\nChoices:\nA.) Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.\nB.) It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.\nC.) Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.\nD.) The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.\nAnswer:\nChoices:\nA. A\nB. B\nC. C\nD. D\n", "answer": "C"}

A signal in a pure analog system can be infinitely detailed, while digital systems cannot produce signals that are more precise than their digital units. With this theoretical advantage there is a practical disadvantage, however.

These errors tend to accumulate as signals are duplicated, until this \"noise\" obliterates the information embodied in the original signal.\nQ: The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following?\nChoices:\nA.) Analog representation of information is impractical because we do not need infinitely detailed information.\nB.)

So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.\nB.) If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads.
