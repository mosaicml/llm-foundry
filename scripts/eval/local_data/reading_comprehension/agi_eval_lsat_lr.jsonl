{"query": "Passage: Editorial: The structure of the present school calendar was established to satisfy the requirements of early-twentieth-century agricultural life. In those days, farmers needed their children to have long breaks during which they could remain at home and help with the harvest. The contemporary school year is thus made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. But agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens, so we can now make changes that serve the interests of children. Therefore, long breaks should be removed from the school calendar.\nQ: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends?\nChoices:\nA.) Children of farmers need to continue observing a school calendar made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks.\nB.) A change in the present school calendar that shortened breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life.\nC.) During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned.\nD.) A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks.\nAnswer:", "choices": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "gold": 3}

{"query": "Passage: Theoretically, analog systems are superior to digital systems. A signal in a pure analog system can be infinitely detailed, while digital systems cannot produce signals that are more precise than their digital units. With this theoretical advantage there is a practical disadvantage, however.

These errors tend to accumulate as signals are duplicated, until this \"noise\" obliterates the information embodied in the original signal.\nQ: The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following?\nChoices:\nA.) Analog representation of information is impractical because we do not need infinitely detailed information.\nB.)

This general line of argument may be reasonable, but it simply does not follow that chimpanzees have anything like human language, because humans did not evolve from chimpanzees. While chimpanzees are indeed closely related to humans, this is because both evolved from a common ancestor. The evolution of human language might easily have begun after the extinction of that common ancestor.\nQ: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the anthropologist's argument?\nChoices:\nA.) Human language is a by-product of human intelligence, which chimpanzees lack.\nB.) The communicative systems of chimpanzees are cruder than human language.\nC.) Humans did not evolve from chimpanzees, but rather from some extinct species.\nD.) The assumption that something like human language must exist in some species from which humans evolved has no clearcut linguistic implications for chimpanzees.\nAnswer:", "choices": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "gold": 3}
