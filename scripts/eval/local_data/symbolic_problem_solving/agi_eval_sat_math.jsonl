Therefore, the meaning of the value 108 in the equation is that Kathy starts each week with 108 phones to fix.Choice $A$ is incorrect because Kathy will complete the repairs when $P=0$. Since $P=108-23 d$, this will occur when $0=108-23 d$ or when $d=\\frac{108}{23}$, not when $d=108$.

Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$.

Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \\mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\\frac{24-8}{20}=\\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the median length of the 21 fish represented in the table is 12 , and after the 24-inch measurement is removed, the median of the remaining 20 lengths is also 12.

The price $p$, in dollars, that Alma paid the cashiers is the sum of the discounted price and the tax: $p=0.8 x+(0.08)(0.8 x)$ which can be rewritten as $p=1.08(0.8 x)$.

The expression in choice $B$ is the result of adding the factors associated with the discount and sales tax, 0.8 and .08, rather than multiplying them.

Adding this expression to the helicopter's initial height gives the helicopter's altitude above the ground $y$, in feet, $t$ seconds after the helicopter begins to gain altitude: $y=40+21 t$.Choice A is incorrect. This is the helicopter's altitude above the ground 1 second after it began to gain altitude, not $t$ seconds after it began to gain altitude. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because adding the expression $-21 t$ makes this function represent a decrease in altitude.

In this study, all conditions are met and the population from which the participants were selected are people with poor eyesight. Therefore, a general conclusion can be drawn about the effect of Treatment $\\mathrm{X}$ on the population of people with poor eyesight. Choice B is incorrect. The study did not include all available treatments, so no conclusion can be made about the relative effectiveness of all available treatments. Choice $C$ is incorrect. The participants were selected at random from a large population of people with poor eyesight. Therefore, the results can be generalized only to that population and not to anyone in general. Also, the conclusion is too strong: an experimental study might show that people are likely to be helped by a treatment, but it cannot show that anyone who takes the treatment will be helped. Choice $\\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. This conclusion is too strong. The study shows that Treatment $X$ is likely to improve the eyesight of people with poor eyesight, but it cannot show that the treatment definitely will cause improvement in eyesight for every person. Furthermore, since the people undergoing the treatment in the study were selected from people with poor eyesight, the results can be generalized only to this population, not to all people."}

This equation gives the volume of each standard edition game as 30 cubic inches and the volume of each collector's edition game as 20 cubic inches. Choice $C$ is incorrect.

{"context": "Q: If 50 one-cent coins were stacked on top of each other in a column, the column would be approximately $3 \\frac{7}{8}$ inches tall. At this rate, which of the following is closest to the number of one-cent coins it would take to make an 8-inch-tall column?", "answer": "100", "chain_of_thought": "A column of 50 stacked one-cent coins is about $3 \\frac{7}{8}$ inches tall, which is slightly less than 4 inches tall. Therefore a column of stacked one-cent coins that is 4 inches tall would contain slightly more than 50 one-cent coins. It can then be reasoned that because 8 inches is twice 4 inches, a column of stacked one-cent coins that is 8 inches tall would contain slightly more than twice as many coins; that is, slightly more than 100 one-cent coins. An alternate approach is to set up a proportion comparing the column height to the number of one-cent coins, or $\\frac{3 \\frac{7}{8} \\text { inches }}{50 \\text { coins }}=\\frac{8 \\text { inches }}{x \\text { coins }}$, where $x$ is the number of coins in an 8-inch-tall column.

{"context": "Q: A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds.

Values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy these two inequalities represent the allowable numbers of 120-pound packages and 100-pound packages the helicopter can transport. To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, $a$, in the helicopter, the number of 100-pound packages, $b$, in the helicopter needs to be minimized. Expressing $b$ in terms of $a$ in the second inequality yields $b \\geq 10-a$, so the minimum value of $b$ is equal to $10-a$. Substituting $10-a$ for $b$ in the first inequality results in $120 a+100(10-(A)\\leq 1,100$. Using the distributive property to rewrite this inequality yields $120 a+1,000-100 a \\leq 1,100$, or $20 a+1,000 \\leq 1,100$. Subtracting 1,000 from both sides of this inequality yields $20 a \\leq 100$. Dividing both sides of this inequality by 20 results in $a \\leq 5$.
