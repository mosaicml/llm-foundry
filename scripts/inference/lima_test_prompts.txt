### Instruction:
I'm writing a NeurIPS paper about a new model architecture for processing and generating long texts. Here are some facts about the paper:
* The main trick is to replace some of the attention heads with an exponential moving average, where the decay rate is learned for each head. We call this architecture ExeMA.
* On language modeling, the perplexity difference between our model and a vanilla transformer is negligible, but that's because next-token prediction is almost always a local task, so perplexity won't be sensitive enough to detect any improvements in long-range understanding.
* However, on the SCROLLS benchmark, our model improves by 10% over the baseline.
* We also have a new metric for measuring coherence in generated text (CoGnaTe), where our model generates text that is 43% more coherent than the baseline.
Help me write the paper's introduction.

Can you summarize this passage into bullet points?

Gradually slowing job gains and a growing labor force in March delivered welcome news to President Biden, nearly a year after he declared that the job market needed to cool significantly to tame high prices. The details of the report are encouraging for a president whose economic goal is to move from rapid job gains — and high inflation — to what Mr. Biden has called “stable, steady growth.” Job creation slowed to 236,000 for the month, closing in on the level Mr. Biden said last year would be necessary to stabilize the economy and prices. More Americans joined the labor force, and wage gains fell slightly. Those developments should help to further cool inflation. But the report also underscored the political and economic tensions for the president as he seeks to sell Americans on his economic stewardship ahead of an expected announcement this spring that he will seek re-election.
