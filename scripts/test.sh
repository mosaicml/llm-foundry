# Script to cd into a subdirectory, install its deps, and run its tests
#
# The tricky part here is that some modules, like flash-attn, are really
# finicky to get installed and depend on details of your environment (e.g.,
# the installed CUDA version). For these deps, we just use whatever's
# in the surrounding environment. We do this by:
#   1) Allowing the venv to use the environment's installed packages
#       via the --system-site-packages flag.
#   2) Having the pip install overwrite everything in the requirements
#       *except* a few whitelisted dependencies.
